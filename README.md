# mastermind-bot-game

Implements a text-based Mastermind game where players attempt to guess combination of colors within a limited number of trials featuring different difficulty levels and options for viewing credits, game rules or exiting.

# Project Objective's

Implement a Mastermind Game: Develop a colour-guessing game where players must guess a combination of four colours in a set number of trials (based on the chosen difficulty level) using Python’s control structures and input/output functions.

Difficulty Levels: Create three levels of gameplay difficulty (easy, medium, hard), where the difficulty increases by reducing the number of attempts a player gets to guess the correct colour sequence.

Feedback System: Provide real-time feedback after each guess, indicating how many colors the player guessed correctly, using loops and conditional statements for logic processing.

User Interface Navigation: Design a simple text-based navigation system for the player to start the game, view instructions, learn about the game’s history, or exit, utilizing string inputs and function calls to manage user interactions and control flow.
